# AAHYWEH
# Control file for L2 (input) to L3 (output) quality control.
#
# TEMPLATE VERSION
#  To convert this template to a version that works for data output by the standard OzFlux
#  data logger program:
#   1) Replace the following place holders with values for your site:
#      <site_name> - the name of the site
#      <year>      - the year of the data
#      <latitude>  - the latitude of the site, decimal degrees
#      <longitude> - the longitude of the site, decimal degrees
#      <height>    - the height of the measurement (above ground), m
#      <depth>     - the depth of the measurement (below ground), cm for depths <= 1m, m for depths > 1m
#      <letter>    - the letter used to distinguish sensors at the same depth or height
#   2) Replace the default quality control limits (eg Lower, Upper etc) with site-specific values.
#
# [General]   - general settings
#    PlotWidth               = 10.7          # default plot width, inches
#    PlotHeight              = 8             # default plot height, inches
# [Files]     - contains paths and file names
# [Output]    - specify the variables to be written to the output file
#               - 2 output list can be specified:
#                 - "xl" defines which variables will be written to the Excel file output at L3
#                 - "nc" defines which variables will be written to the netCDF file output at L3
#               - if no list is specified, all variables are written out
# [Variables] - variable names and quality control keys, only those variables
#               corrected or calculated at this level need to be specified in
#               this control file.
#               Valid quality control sections are:
#                RangeCheck   - reject data less than "Lower" or greater than "Upper"
#                DiurnalCheck - reject data outside Avg(H.h)+/-NumSd*Stdev(H.h) where
#                                Avg(H.h) is the average of all data at time H.h and
#                                Stdev(H.h) is the standard deviation of all data at time H.h
#                                 eg H.h = 8.5 is 0830
#                 NOTE: The "Lower", "Upper" and "NumSd" keywords require a value for each
#                       month of the year (12).  This can be written in shorthand as:
#                        eg "[100]*12" (same value for each month)
#                       or in longhand as:
#                        eg "[100,110,120,130,140,150,150,140,130,120,110,100]" (different each month)
#                  [[[RangeCheck]]]

#                      NumSd      = "[3]*12"
#                ExcludeDates - reject data between specified dates, multiple date ranges can be
#                               specified on separate lines but the lines must be numbered
#                               sequentially from 0 (eg 0, 1, 2 etc)
#                 NOTE: The date range is specified as:

#                ExcludeHours - reject data at specified times between the specified date range,
#                               multiple ranges can be specified on separate lines but the
#                               lines must be numbered sequentially from 0 (eg 0, 1, 2, etc)
#                 NOTE: The date range and hours to be rejected are specified as:

#                               multiple ranges can be specified on separate lines but the
#                               lines must be numbered sequentially from 0 (eg 0, 1, 2, etc)

#                Correction   - apply an offset to a wind direction measurement to correct for alignment
#                               multiple ranges can be specified on separate lines but the
#                               lines must be numbered sequentially from 0 (eg 0, 1, 2, etc)
#                 NOTE: The date range and correction are specified as follows:
