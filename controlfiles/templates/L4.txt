# Control file for gap filling L3 data to produce L4 data.
#
# The techniques to be used to gap fill L3 data are still in development so there will be changes
# to this file over time.  At present, some very basic gap filling tools based on climatology
# have been implemented.  These are robust and will work quite well for yearly data sets that
# have few gaps of short duration.
#
# The way in which this control file is interpreted by the Python script files is fundamentally
# different to the way in which the L1, L2 and L3 control files are interpreted.
#
# With the L1, L2 and l3 control files, the order of the variables in the control file was not
# important and the order of the sub-sections for each variable was not important.  With the L4
# control file, the order of the variable in the [Variables] section determines the order in which
# the variables are gap filled.  This is necessary because the gap filling of some variables depends
# on other variables. For example, the method used to gap fill latent heat flux (Fe) uses the available
# energy (Fa) so the entry for Fa in this control file must appear before the entry for Fe.  Likewise,
# the method used to gap fill NEE (Fc) filters Fc for low ustar values as the first step, so the entry
# for ustar must appear in the control file before the entry for Fc.
#
# The order of the sub-section entries for each variable determines the order in which the various
# gap filling techniques are applied.  There are only a limited number of techniques available
# at present but this dependence on order will become more important as other techniques are added
# to this process (eg gap fill using Reichstein (match and replace), gap fill using Penman-Monteith
# and light use efficiency, gap fill using neural networks etc).  As an example, in the entries for
# the fluxes of sensible heat, latent heat and CO2 (Fh, Fe and Fc), the first gap filling method listed
# is GapFillFluxFromDayRatio and the second is GapFillFromClimatology.  In this case, the
# GapFillFluxFromDayRatio method will be applied first and then the GapFillFromClimatology method
# will be used.  The order in which the methods are used depends on their characteristics.
# GapFillFluxFromDayRatio works quite well but may still leave some gaps in the data in some rare
# cases.  GapFillFromClimatology works less well but does not leave gaps.  To use GapFillFluxFromDayRatio
# first and then GapFillFromClimatology second means most (usually all) of the data is gap filled
# using the best performing technique first and then any remaining gaps are filled by schemes that
# are more conservative but more robust.
#
# There are 3 gap filling techniques available at present:
# 1) GapFillFromAlternate
#    This method replaces missing data with data from an alternate site.  This method is able to
#    apply a linear transform to the data from the alternate site so that it matches, on average,
#    the data from the site being gap filled.
#    Examples of alternate sites are:
#    a) a near-by flux tower.
#    b) a psuedo-tower data set derived from gridded meteorological fields:
#       - these are usually available at daily time steps and must be interpolated
#         down to the time step of the data set being gap filled.
#    c) a compsite of pseudo-tower data and data from a Bureau of Meteorology Automatic
#       Weather Station:
#       - as an example, temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction and rainfall data
#         may come from a nearby AWS with down-welling shortwave (Fsd) being derived from a daily
#         time step, gridded product (eg AWAP, SILO) by interpolation, up-welling shortwave
#         from Fsd and albedo, and longwave from temperature etc.
#    d) an AWS plus radiation data from an alternate site.
#    WARNING - at present, this method assumes the alternate site is a flux tower and that all
#              required data (meteorological, radiation, soil) is present in the alternate site
#              data set.  This method is still under development.
# 2) GapFillFromClimatology
#    This method uses the information in the Climatology_YYYY.xls Excel spreadsheet to fill gaps
#    in the data set.  The climatology spreadsheet is produced by running the "climatology.py" script
#    file on an L3 netCDF file.  The climatological data for basic meteorological drivers (temperature,
#    humidity, radiation) is given as monthly averages for each time step during the day.  This method
#    simply inserts the monthly average for the appropriate time of day into gaps in the data set.
#    WARNING - this method will produce sudden jumps in gap filled quatities when the date changes from
#              month to the next.  This method is still under development and will be modified to use
#              an interpolation scheme to interpolate from monthly averages down to daily time steps
#              to avoid the sudden jumps at month boundaries.
# 3) GapFillFluxFromDayRatio
#    This method is only used for gap filling the fluxes of sensible heat, latent heat and CO2 (Fh,
#    Fe and Fc).  The method uses ratios of various fluxes based on climatological data for the site
#    to gap fill day time data (Fsd>50 W/m2) and uses climatological data (filtered to remove low
#    ustar values in the case of Fc) to gap fill night time data (Fsd<50 W/m2).  Both the ratios
#    and the climatological data are derived from measurements at the site and are calculated by the
#    climatology script ("climatology.py").
#    The ratios used are:
#    a) Evaporative fraction (EF=Fe/Fa) - the ratio of latent heat flux to available energy.
#    b) Bowen ratio (BR=Fh/Fe) - the ratio of sensible to latent heat flux.
#    c) Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE=Fc/Fe) - the ratio of CO2 flux to latent heat.
#    The reason for using ratios to gap fill day time fluxes is that these quantities vary less from
#    hour to hour and from day to day than the fluxes themselves.  This means that gaps in the ratios
#    due to gaps in the measured fluxes can be more accurately filled using interpolation than gaps
#    in the fluxes themselves.  Once the gaps in the evaporative fraction have been filled by
#    interpolation, the missing day time Fe data can be filled using Fe=EF*Fa.  Once the gaps in the
#    Bowen ratio have been filled by interpolation and Fe has been gap filled as described above then
#    the day time Fh is gap filled using Fh=BR*Fe.  Once the gaps in the ecosystem water use efficiency
#    have been filled by interpolation and Fe has been filled as described above then the day time Fc
#    is gap filled using Fc=WUE*Fe.  The interpolated ratios are calculated by the "climatology.py"
#    script file and written to the climatology spreadsheet.
#    Night time gaps are filled using monthly climatological averages of the measured fluxes.  The
#    monthly averages at each time step through out the day are calculated by the "climatology.py" script
#    file and written to the climatology spreadsheet.  The monthly averages are calculated without
#    applying a ustar filetr and with a ustar filter.  The ustar threshold is specified in the
#    control file for the "climatology.py" script and is written to the worksheet containing the
#    climatological flux averages.  The monthly climatological averages (at each time step during the
#    day) are interpolated onto a daily time step before being used to gap fill the missing night time
#    fluxes.
